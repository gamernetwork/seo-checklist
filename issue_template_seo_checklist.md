# SEO Checklist

## Site-wide 

### Accessibility

- [ ] **Pagination**: help search engines handle pagination by implementing the `rel="next"` and `rel="prev"` tag.

- [ ] **Redirects**: use 301-redirects instead of 302 where appropriate.

- [ ] **Site speed**: site speed has become a ranking factor. Faster is better. Use Google Page Speed to check the loading time of your pages.

- [ ] **Duplicate content**: check for duplicate content in Google Webmaster tools, via the site: search command or via site crawling software. Duplicate content issues can be solved via a 301-redirect, the `rel="canonical"` tag, meta robots tag, URL rewriting or Google Webmaster Tools. 

### URL Structure

- [ ] **www or non-www**: Make sure site redirects to canonical domain.

- [ ] **Subdomain for forum**: If forum will pollute relevance of site, move to subdomain.

- [ ] **URL parameters**: If you have filter pages with lots of possible URL combinations, either noindex or use WMT param tools to compress URL range.

### Sitemaps

- [ ] **XML sitemap**: this sitemap is only visible for search engines. XML sitemaps allow you to add metadata which can be used to provide additional information about the content of each page. An XML sitemap can contain a maximum of 50,000 links.

## Per-page

### Content

- [ ] **Title**: max. 70 characters long.

### Images

- [ ] **File name**: choose a descriptive file name instead of random words and numbers. 

- [ ] **Alt-tag**: don't forget to add an alt-tag with a short description of the image. 

- [ ] **Size**: keep your images as small as possible to improve page load times.

### Display in SERP

- [ ] **Meta description**: change the description of a page in the SERPs by adding a meta-description tag. A good description convinces surfers to click on the link. Don't forget to use keywords because they appear in bold.

## Off-site SEO

- [ ] **Inbound links from Network**: get this site linked from footers of network sites.
